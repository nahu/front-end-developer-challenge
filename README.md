### App

Players of TitanStar Legends can spend talent points that theyâ€™ve collected on runes within a tree. We need to write a js application that simulates the rune tree within the game so players can replicate their in-game loadouts to share with the TitanStar Legends community.

- Left click to add points.
- Right click to remove points.
- The user may only use up to 6 points.
- Each item only accounts for one point.
- Displays current point total
- The user must select the items in order. For example: The user may not put a point in the cake without first having put points in the chevrons and the silverware (in that order).
